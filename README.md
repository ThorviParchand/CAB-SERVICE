# CAB-SERVICE
This Cab Booking Application is a backend system built using Microservices architecture with Spring Boot. It allows users to book cabs, make payments, receive notifications, and manage their profiles in a secure and modular environment. Each microservice is independently deployable and communicates via REST APIs, ensuring scalability and maintainability.

üì¶ Microservices Overview
User Service: Handles user registration, login, and role-based access (Admin, Rider).
Cab Service: Manages cab details, driver profiles, cab availability, and location tracking.
Booking Service: Handles ride booking, ride history, and booking status.
Payment Service: Manages fare calculation, payment processing, and transaction history.
Notification Service: Sends email/SMS notifications for booking updates, payment status, and alerts.
API Gateway: Routes client requests to respective services.
Eureka Discovery Server: Enables dynamic service registration and lookup.

üîê Security & Access Control
Implemented using Spring Security with JWT-based authentication. Users are authenticated through secure login, and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) restricts endpoint access. Passwords are encrypted using BCrypt. The API Gateway validates tokens before forwarding requests.

üì¨ REST API & Testing
All services expose RESTful APIs following standard HTTP methods and status codes. APIs are tested using Postman, ensuring reliability and proper error handling across services.
